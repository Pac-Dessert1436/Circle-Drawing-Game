## Personal Notes
Creating this game brought to mind a quote by Luo Xiang: "I can never draw a perfect circle, but I believe there must be a perfect circle in the world."

This pursuit of an ideal - one we can approach but never fully attain - mirrors life itself. While none of us can draw a truly perfect circle, the act of trying teaches us about growth through incremental progress. Each attempt hones our precision, and small, consistent improvements eventually lead to meaningful skill development.

Yet this principle has a dual nature: just as deliberate practice builds skill, carelessness erodes it. Neglecting symmetry and proportion turns what could be a circle into something unrecognizable. It's a reminder that growth requires both dedication to improvement and vigilance against complacency.

The perfect circle may remain an ideal, but the journey toward it shapes us in ways far more valuable than the destination.
